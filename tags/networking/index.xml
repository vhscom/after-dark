      <description>Using Serveo you may briefly expose your site to the Internet with end-to-end encryption, no sign-up required. Use this to Work Offline and quietly poke a hole through your NAT or firewall to move information more discretely.
Warning: No form of communication over the Internet is 100% secure.  Serve and expose your site with the following command:
$ hugo serve --disableLiveReload &amp;amp; ssh -R 80:localhost:1313 serveo.net Once started press g for traffic inspection, or quit to go offline and use fg to return to hugo.</description>

      <description>After Dark includes an extensive online help manual and example website.

If help is not running you may start it anytime via script:
cd flying-toasters &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \ ./themes/after-dark/bin/help  Or simply create an alias and serve docs with live-reload:
alias hs=&amp;#39;hugo serve --navigateToChanged&amp;#39; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \ hs --port 1414 --source themes/after-dark/docs  Help is included within the After Dark source code.</description>

Review the Online Help docs during a flight on Virgin Galactic. Keep a personal journal while couchsurfing through Southeast Asia. Securely generate configuration for the Web Mining add-on module. Develop your content using Termux on Android in airplane mode. Create an Image Gallery while trekking the Mount Nimbus via ferrata.  By default After Dark makes no outbound requests except when viewing certain Online Help documentation to cover related functionality.
